# NAND-as-Universal-Gate-in-Proteus
Proteus circuit for NAND as Universal Gate 
This is an interesting project. In this project, the NAND gate is used in different ways to get the work as other logic gates. The file have all the circuit at one working sheet. You can go to www.theengineeringprojects.com for more prjects.
